My project is a Roulette game. The player will input their name, select the number they can choose from the board and then click to throw the ball on the spinning wheel. If the number the player chooses matches the number the ball lands on the roulette spinner, they win, if numbers do not match, they lose. After either outcome the user can choose to click a button to play again.

## Priority Matrix

Include a full list of features that have been prioritized based on the `Time and Importance` Matix.

## MVP

Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP 

- The player will start by typing out their name and clicking a submit button.

- They will then be able to select any number 1-36 on the roulette table.

- Once they select their number, they can click another button to throw the ball on the spinning roulette wheel.


- The winning logic will only take into conisderation the one number the player chose that has a specific degree saved in its object and compare it to the degree of which the ball landed on the wheel.

## POST MVP

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP

POST MVP features are laid out to essentially make the game as realistic as possible:

- Add additional bets to choose from outside of just selecting one number 1-36
    (even/odd, red/black, dozens and halves)

- Add additional form to submit a $ bid amount The user could start out with a set amount of money and either win a certain payout if their bet hits, or lose the money wagered if it doesnt.

- Add the option to place multiple bets other than just one option.

## Wireframes

Include images of your wireframes.
