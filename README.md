## Project Description

*I love hue* is the original single player game that makes puzzles out of gradients. This game is a clone of called *welp need a name*. At the beginning of the level, the player is presented with a board made up of tiles closely spaced together. Each tile has an individual color that together with it's siblings make gradient. The board then is re-arranged and player has to recreate that gradient.
